Server side for a registration and login form

I have used MongoDB for database and I have used bcrypt to encrypt the password to avoid data leakage.

Difficulty Faced : The application asked for "Email/Mobile Number and Password" for authorization

I could not perform authorization from "Email/Mobile Number and Password" instead I have used only "Email and Password" for authorization.
